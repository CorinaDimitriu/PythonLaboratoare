I visited Naples in the year 1818. On the 8th of December of that year,
my companion and I crossed the Bay, to visit the antiquities which are
scattered on the shores of Baia. The translucent and shining waters of
the calm sea covered fragments of old Roman villas, which were
interlaced by sea-weed, and received diamond tints from the chequering
of the sun-beams; the blue and pellucid element was such as Galatea
might have skimmed in her car of mother of pearl; or Cleopatra, more
fitly than the Nile, have chosen as the path of her magic ship.
